## React + Vite + useElven

https://useelven-react-vite-demo.netlify.app/

A demo where you can sign in using MultiversX signing providers and you can send a transaction to predefined address

All is based on [useElven](https://www.useelven.com) React tools.

This is basically a starting point when you would want to use React + Vite. Check the vite.config.js file. There is an important configuration to make it work.

There will be more examples and documentations.
